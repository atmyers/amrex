    "\n",
    "To do the same thing with ParaView 5.8 manually,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start Paraview 5.8\n",

    "4. Check the \"phi\" box in the \"Cell Array Status\" menu that appears\n",
    "5. Click green Apply button\n",
    "6. Click on the \"slice\" icon -- three to the right of the calculator\n",
    "   This will create \"Slice 1\" in the Pipeline Browser which will be highlighted.\n",
    "7. Click on \"Z Normal\"\n",
    "8. Unclick the \"Show Plane\" button\n",
    "9. Click green Apply button\n",
    "10. Change the drop-down menu option (above the calculator row) from \"vtkBlockColors\" to \"phi\"\n",
